jupyter notebook notebooks/IPL_EDA_Improved.ipynb
```

### Quick Start
1. Run **Section 0** to load libraries
2. Section 1 auto-downloads the dataset via `kagglehub`
3. Run all cells in sequence

## 📈 Analysis Sections

| Section | Question Answered |
|---------|------------------|
| Match Analysis | How many matches per season? |
| Team Wins | Which teams won the most? |
| Win Percentage | Which team is most consistent? |
| Top Scorers | Who scored the most runs? |
| Strike Rate | Who bats most aggressively? |
| Wicket Takers | Who took the most wickets? |
| Economy Rate | Who is the most economical bowler? |
| Toss Impact | Does toss affect match outcome? |
| Over Phases | How do scoring rates differ by phase? |
| Chase Analysis | How does target size affect chase success? |
| Dismissal Types | What are the most common dismissals? |
| Home vs Away | Do teams perform better at home? |
| Season Heatmap | How has each team performed per season? |

---

## 🔢 Key Metrics

```
Win %       = (Wins ÷ Matches Played) × 100
Strike Rate = (Runs ÷ Balls Faced) × 100
Economy     = Runs Conceded ÷ (Deliveries ÷ 6)
```

## 📤 Outputs

Running the full notebook exports:
- `ipl_cleaned_data.csv` — cleaned ball-by-ball data
- `summary_statistics.csv` — key aggregate metrics

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Missing module | `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn kagglehub` |
| No CSV found | Check `kagglehub` download path; rerun Section 1 |
| Column not found | Print `ipl.columns` and verify names |
| Empty plots | Check for missing values with `ipl.isnull().sum()` |
| Small plots | Set `plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (15, 8)` |
